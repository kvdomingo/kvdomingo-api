    Today's activity involved the basics on digitally extracting values from hand-drawn plots. The image I used is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:radial-profile">1</a>. For the pixel coordinate extraction, I used Photoshop, and for everything else, Python's <code>matplotlib</code> module.

    In order to determine the pixel-to-centimeter conversion factor, I first tabulated the pixel coordinates of the $x$ and $y$ axis units. I noticed that the ticks were not equidistant, and that the $x$ and $y$ axes were not of the same scale, so I performed linear regression by plotting the pixel vs cm values separately for both axes. The calibration curves can then be obtained from Fig. <a href="#fig:calibration">2</a>. The conversion factors obtained were: <span id="eq:calibrate"> \begin{align} x_{\mathrm{cm}} &amp; = (0.02)x_{\mathrm{px}} - 6.62 \\ y_{\mathrm{cm}} &amp; = (-0.04)y_{\mathrm{px}} + 14.50 \end{align} </span> Using these conversion factors, it's simply a matter of plugging in pixel values into (<a href="#eq:calib">1</a>) or (<a href="#eq:calib">2</a>) in order to extract the real cm units. In Fig. <a href="#fig:radial-profile">1</a>, we can see three elements: a bell curve, a sigmoid-like curve, and an apparently straight line (it actually curves ever so slightly upward). To extract the values of the bell curve, I simply took the pixel location of the center of the round markers. For the sigmoid, I sampled at points on the line immediately adjacent to the hollow markers. For the dashed line, I sampled at each $x$-axis unit.

    After performing the necessary conversions, I could then plot my extracted curves while overlaying original image all in one go. Because <code>matplotlib</code>'s <code>imshow</code> function displays images in terms of pixels, I had to specify its <code>extent</code> and <code>aspect</code> parameters. To do this, I have to determine the length and width of the image as a whole, i.e., I have to extend the axes of the original plot so that it encompasses the image as a whole. This task is already trivial since I have already calculated conversion factors earlier. The end product is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:fit">3</a>.

    Even though it was suggested to use Paint, GIMP, and/or a spreadsheet software, I opted to use Photoshop and matplotlib since I have been accustomed to using them and I believe I can work faster and more eciently by using them. Personally, I find using Excel cumbersome and <em>makalat tignan</em> for data processing, and I am especially not fond of the appearance of its plots.
